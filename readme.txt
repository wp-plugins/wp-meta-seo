== Description ==

WP meta SEO got 2 major functionnalities: bulk edit all website meta with intuitive interface and optimize wrong image size.

It was so annoying before and almost nobody was able to edit all meta content and image meta. 
WP Meta SEO is going to list all articles, pages, custom post and all images. Update meta and image size and everything is AJAX saved.
You can now optimize the size of your images in articles. A bunch of people reduce the size of the pictures handling the border and resizing in html/css.
